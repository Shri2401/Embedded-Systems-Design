# 8051- Development Board
This repository contains the firmware and schematics for an assembled 8051-development board featuring the AT89C51RC2 chip with 32KB NVSRAM. Below you'll find details about the contents of this repository and how to navigate it effectively.

## Contents:
Lab 3 Folder: UART Programs
This folder contains firmware for UART communication on the 8051 development board. UART device drivers have been developed using circular buffers for efficient data handling.
Lab 4 Folder: I2C and SPI Programs
In this folder, you'll find firmware for interfacing EEPROM via I2C bit-banging and integrating SPI-based DAC module. The programs showcase the usage of I2C and SPI communication protocols on the 8051 platform.

## Schematic Design Files

Both Lab 3 and Lab 4 folders include schematic designs for the 8051 development board. These schematics provide insights into the hardware components and their connections on the board.

## Features and Highlights:
UART Device Drivers: Efficient UART communication has been achieved using circular buffers for data handling.

I2C and SPI Integration: Interfacing EEPROM via I2C bit-banging and integrating an SPI-based DAC module demonstrate advanced communication capabilities of the 8051 development board.

## Hardware/Software Interaction Analysis
Bus cycle analysis using Oscilloscope and Logic Analyzer, along with firmware debugging techniques such as breakpoint insertion and signal analysis, have been employed to assess hardware/software interactions effectively.
